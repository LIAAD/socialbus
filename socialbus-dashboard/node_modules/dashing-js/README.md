Every new Dashing project comes with sample widgets & sample dashboards for you to explore. The directory is setup as follows:

* Assets — All your images, fonts, and js/coffeescript libraries. Uses <del>[Sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets)</del> [Mincer](http://nodeca.github.io/mincer/).
* Dashboards — One .jade file for each dashboard that contains the layout for the widgets.
* Jobs — Your js/coffee jobs for fetching data (e.g for calling third party APIs like twitter). Name them *\*.job.js/\*.job.coffee*
* Lib — Optional js/coffee files to help out your jobs.
* Public — Static files that you want to serve. A good place for a favicon or a custom 404 page.
* Widgets — All the html/css/coffee for individual widgets.

Run `dashing-js` from command line to find out what command line tools are available to you.

## Deployment
dashing-js is setup to be easily deployed on a Joyent Node SmartMachine. This means that:

1. The version of Node is defined in package.json
2. The main script to run is server.js
3. The web server port is pulled from process.env.PORT
